<p>The Elizabeth F. Cheney Foundation is a private independent foundation. Its principal focus is to support the arts and cultural organizations.  Organizations supported include, but are not limited to, musical performance organizations, theatre and dance companies, historical societies and museums. The overall grant making focus of the foundation is on artistic achievement in presentation or performance rather than educational enrichment or outreach.</p>

<p>Grants are not typically given to help meet operating budgets, and the Foundation does not generally make unrestricted grants. Rather, grants are project-oriented with the goal of funding worthwhile projects which otherwise might not receive necessary funding.</p>

<p>Unsolicited grant requests will be considered only for organizations in the Chicago Metropolitan area.</p>

<p>The Elizabeth F. Cheney Foundation accepts both letters of inquiry (via post or email) and phone inquiries. This communication should include a brief description of the proposed project, a project budget and other projected sources of support. Grants are made only to tax-exempt organizations.</p>

<p>The Elizabeth F. Cheney Foundation application form and supporting documents are due according to the following schedule:</p>
