<p>For sixteen years, The Elizabeth F. Cheney Foundation has consistently focused on enriching the cultural and artistic life of the metropolitan Chicago area through our grantmaking program. We are primarily interested in supporting artistic excellence in performance or presentation. The artistic projects we support are worthy intrinsically as well as being essential for a rich civic life.</p>

<p>Our grantmaking program supports the musical and theatre arts, dance, museums and public television and radio media. We look for arts organizations which are rigorously engaged with their craft and which are supported by a solid management structure. We are proud of the organizations which we support and proud of their artistic efforts. We feel grateful for the opportunity to serve them.</p>
